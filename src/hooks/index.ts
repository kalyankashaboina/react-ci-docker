/**
 * Custom React Hooks
 *
 * This directory contains all custom React hooks used throughout the application.
 * Hooks should follow these principles:
 *
 * - Prefix hook names with 'use' (e.g., useUserData, useFetchData)
 * - Keep hooks focused and single-purpose
 * - Abstract common stateful logic to avoid repetition (DRY principle)
 * - Make hooks self-contained and reusable across components
 *
 * Examples:
 * - useUserData: Fetch and manage user data
 * - usePaginatedList: Handle pagination logic
 * - useLocalStorage: Interact with browser's localStorage
 */

// Export custom hooks here
// export { useUserData } from './useUserData';
// export { usePaginatedList } from './usePaginatedList';
